  summary: Get an execution payload header with proof.
  description: |
    Requests a builder node to produce a valid execution payload header with proof, which
    can be integrated into a blinded beacon block and signed.

    If the builder is unable to produce a valid execution payload header, then
    the builder MUST return a 204 response. If the request is invalid, then the
    builder MUST return an error response (400) with a description of the
    validation failure.

    After Deneb, return the KZG commitments for any associated blobs attached to the execution payload, along with the proof of inclusion.
